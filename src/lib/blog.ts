    content: `## The Biggest Development in Vancouver's History

The Oakridge Park redevelopment is unlike anything Vancouver has seen before. What was once a conventional shopping mall at 41st and Cambie is being transformed into a 28-acre mixed-use community that will fundamentally reshape this corner of the city.

Developed by QuadReal Property Group (a subsidiary of British Columbia Investment Management Corporation), the project represents roughly **$6 billion in total investment** — making it one of the largest private developments in Canadian history.

## What's Being Built

The numbers are staggering:

- **3,300+ residential units** including condos, townhomes, and rental apartments
- **9-acre public park** on the rooftop — larger than two football fields
- **560,000 sq ft of retail space** with a reimagined shopping experience
- **Office space** for a new generation of Vancouver businesses
- **Community centre** with a 50-metre swimming pool, ice rink, and fitness centre
- **Childcare facilities** for 200+ children
- **A 1.2-acre civic centre plaza** for community events

The design preserves key view corridors to the North Shore mountains while creating a pedestrian-friendly environment connected directly to the Oakridge–41st Avenue Canada Line station.

## Timeline: Where Are We Now?

Construction has been underway since 2019, and here's the current status as of early 2026:

- **Phase 1 residential towers**: Substantially complete, first occupancies beginning
- **Retail podium**: Interior finishing underway, partial opening expected mid-2026
- **Rooftop park**: Landscaping and amenity installation in progress
- **Community centre**: Construction advancing, expected completion 2027
- **Remaining residential phases**: Continuing through 2028

The full project completion is expected by **2028-2029**, but residents and shoppers will be enjoying major portions of the development well before then.

## Impact on Property Values

The Oakridge Park redevelopment has already had a significant impact on surrounding property values:

**For Sellers:**
- Properties within a 10-minute walk of Oakridge Park have seen **15-25% appreciation** above the citywide average since the project was announced
- Detached homes on the west side of Cambie between 37th and 49th have been particularly strong
- Older condos in the area are commanding premium prices due to proximity to the new development

**For Buyers:**
- Pre-sale units within Oakridge Park are priced at a premium — expect $1,200-$1,800+ per square foot depending on the tower and floor
- Resale properties nearby offer better value but still benefit from the "Oakridge effect"
- The best value may be found in adjacent Marpole, where you're still close to Oakridge amenities but at lower price points

**For Investors:**
- Rental demand in the area is extremely strong, driven by the Canada Line and new amenities
- Expected rental yields are competitive with other transit-oriented locations
- The community centre, park, and retail will create lasting neighbourhood appeal that protects long-term value

## Transit & Connectivity

One of Oakridge Park's greatest advantages is its transit connectivity:

- **Oakridge–41st Avenue SkyTrain Station** (Canada Line) — direct connection to downtown (15 min), YVR airport (20 min), and Richmond
- **Multiple bus routes** along 41st Avenue and Cambie Street
- **New cycling infrastructure** being integrated into the development
- **Pedestrian bridges** connecting the development to surrounding streets

## What This Means for You

If you're considering buying or selling in the Oakridge area, the redevelopment creates both opportunities and considerations:

**If you're buying:** This is a once-in-a-generation neighbourhood transformation. Properties purchased now will benefit from years of increasing amenity and infrastructure as the development completes. The key is understanding which micro-locations within the area offer the best value.

**If you're selling:** Your property may be worth more than you think. The "Oakridge premium" is real, but timing matters. As more phases of Oakridge Park complete, the premium could increase further — or it could plateau as supply catches up with demand.

**Either way**, having an agent who deeply understands this specific market is essential. I track every sale, every listing, and every development update in this area. Let me help you make the most informed decision possible.

    content: `## Buying Your First Home in BC: Every Program That Can Help

Purchasing your first home in British Columbia is a significant milestone — and an expensive one. The good news? There are more programs than ever to help first-time buyers get into the market. Here's a comprehensive guide to every program available in 2026.

## 1. First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The FHSA is one of the most powerful tools for first-time buyers in Canada.

**How it works:**
- Contribute up to **$8,000 per year** (lifetime max of $40,000)
- Contributions are **tax-deductible** (like an RRSP)
- Withdrawals for a home purchase are **tax-free** (like a TFSA)
- You get the best of both worlds: tax deduction going in, no tax coming out

**Eligibility:**
- Must be a Canadian resident, age 18-71
- Must be a first-time home buyer (haven't owned a home in the year the account is opened or the previous 4 years)
- Account must be open for at least one year before withdrawal

**My tip:** Even if you're not planning to buy immediately, open an FHSA now. The one-year minimum holding period means earlier is better. Plus, unused contribution room carries forward (up to $8,000).

## 2. BC Property Transfer Tax (PTT) First-Time Buyer Exemption

When you buy a property in BC, you normally pay Property Transfer Tax. First-time buyers can get a **full or partial exemption**.

**Full exemption:** Properties valued up to **$835,000** (as of 2024 — check current thresholds)
**Partial exemption:** Properties valued between $835,000 and $860,000
**Newly built homes:** Full exemption up to $1,100,000; partial up to $1,150,000

**Savings:** On a $835,000 home, the PTT would normally be **$14,700**. With the first-time buyer exemption, you pay **$0**.

**Eligibility:**
- Canadian citizen or permanent resident
- Lived in BC for at least one year, OR filed two BC tax returns in the last six years
- Never owned property anywhere in the world
- Must live in the home as your principal residence

## 3. RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

Withdraw up to **$60,000** from your RRSPs tax-free to buy your first home (increased from $35,000 in the 2024 Federal Budget).

**Key details:**
- Can be combined with your partner's withdrawal for up to **$120,000** per couple
- Must repay over 15 years (starting the second year after withdrawal)
- Can be used alongside the FHSA

**My tip:** You can contribute to your RRSP and claim the deduction, then withdraw under the HBP 90+ days later. This gives you the tax deduction benefit even if you're buying soon.

## 4. First-Time Home Buyer Tax Credit (Federal)

A non-refundable tax credit of up to **$10,000**, providing up to **$1,500** in tax relief.

It's modest compared to the other programs, but it's automatic — you just claim it on your tax return after purchasing.

## 5. GST/HST New Housing Rebate

If you're buying a **newly built home**, you may be eligible for a GST rebate of up to **$6,300** on the federal portion. In BC, there's an additional provincial rebate.

**Eligibility:**
- Must be a new or substantially renovated home
- Purchase price thresholds apply (check current limits)
- Must be your primary residence

## 6. BC Home Owner Grant

While not specific to first-time buyers, the BC Home Owner Grant reduces your annual property taxes by up to **$570** (or $770 in northern/rural areas).

**Eligibility:**
- Property must be your principal residence
- Assessed value thresholds apply
- Applied annually through your municipality

## Stacking These Programs: A Real Example

Let's say you're a first-time buyer purchasing a $800,000 condo in Vancouver:

| Program | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| FHSA (maxed at $40K) | $40,000 tax-free savings + ~$12,000 in tax deductions |
| RRSP HBP | Additional $60,000 from RRSPs, tax-free |
| PTT Exemption | Save $14,000 in Property Transfer Tax |
| Federal Tax Credit | $1,500 tax credit |
| **Total Benefits** | **$67,500+ in savings and tax benefits** |

## The Order of Operations

1. **Today**: Open an FHSA and start contributing
2. **1+ years before buying**: Max RRSP contributions you'll withdraw via HBP
3. **Pre-approval**: Get mortgage pre-approval to know your budget
4. **When you find the right home**: Use FHSA + HBP for down payment
5. **At closing**: Apply PTT exemption
6. **Tax time**: Claim federal FTHB credit

## Vancouver-Specific Considerations

The reality is that Vancouver's prices mean not all these programs apply equally:

- The PTT first-time buyer exemption has a **price ceiling** — in Vancouver's market, many homes exceed it. Condos and townhomes are more likely to qualify.
- A **minimum 5% down payment** is required for homes up to $500K; 10% on the portion above $500K. For an $800K condo, that's $55,000 minimum.
- **Mortgage stress test**: You must qualify at the higher of your contract rate + 2% or 5.25%.

## How I Can Help

Navigating these programs while house-hunting in Vancouver is complex. As your realtor, I'll:

- Help you understand which programs you qualify for
- Connect you with mortgage brokers who specialize in first-time buyers
- Find properties that maximize your program eligibility
- Guide you through the entire process from pre-approval to keys in hand

    content: `## Finding Your Family's Perfect Vancouver Neighbourhood

Choosing where to raise your family in Vancouver is one of the most important decisions you'll make. Beyond just the home itself, the neighbourhood shapes your daily life — school quality, park access, community feel, safety, and convenience all matter.

Here are my top picks for family-friendly neighbourhoods in Vancouver for 2026, based on data, local knowledge, and the families I've helped settle in.

## 1. Oakridge

**Best for:** Families wanting top schools, transit access, and a neighbourhood in transformation

Oakridge is my top pick for families in 2026, and not just because it's my specialty area. The combination of excellent schools, direct SkyTrain access, and the massive Oakridge Park redevelopment makes this neighbourhood unbeatable.

**Schools:** Sir Wilfrid Laurier Elementary and Jamieson Elementary are both highly regarded. For secondary, Sir Winston Churchill is one of Vancouver's top public high schools.

**Parks:** Queen Elizabeth Park (one of Vancouver's most beautiful), plus the upcoming 9-acre Oakridge Park rooftop green space.

**Family perks:** New community centre coming (with pool, ice rink, childcare), direct Canada Line access, diverse dining options, and strong multicultural community.

**Price range:** GVR benchmarks (Jan 2026) — Condos $998K; Townhomes $1.64M; Detached $3.36M

## 2. Riley Park / Little Mountain

**Best for:** Families who value community feel and outdoor lifestyle

Riley Park offers a charming, established neighbourhood feel with excellent parks and a strong sense of community. It's slightly more affordable than neighbouring areas while still being centrally located.

**Schools:** Sir William Van Horne Elementary is well-regarded. Emily Carr Elementary is another solid option.

**Parks:** Riley Park itself is excellent, with sports fields, a community centre, and Nat Bailey Stadium nearby. Hillcrest Park and the aquatic centre are also close.

**Family perks:** Main Street shopping and dining nearby, community gardens, Hillcrest Community Centre with pool, and easy access to Queen Elizabeth Park.

**Price range:** GVR benchmarks (Jan 2026) — Condos $639K; Townhomes $1.04M; Detached $1.70M (Vancouver East)

## 3. Kerrisdale

**Best for:** Families seeking a quieter, established upscale neighbourhood

Kerrisdale has long been one of Vancouver's premier family neighbourhoods. The tree-lined streets, village-like shopping district, and excellent schools create an enviable lifestyle.

**Schools:** Kerrisdale Elementary is one of the most sought-after in Vancouver. Point Grey Secondary is also highly regarded.

**Parks:** Kerrisdale Centennial Park, Elm Park, and close proximity to the Arbutus Greenway cycling and walking trail.

**Family perks:** Charming village shopping on 41st Avenue, community centre, ice rink, swimming pool, and a strong neighbourhood association.

**Price range:** GVR benchmarks (Jan 2026) — Condos $974K; Townhomes $1.66M; Detached $2.98M

## 4. South Cambie

**Best for:** Families wanting walkability, transit, and convenience

South Cambie runs along the Cambie Corridor — one of Vancouver's most transit-accessible areas. With the Canada Line running through it and the Cambie Village shops, it's incredibly convenient for busy families.

**Schools:** Sir William Osler Elementary is the local school. Nearby options include Laurier and Jamieson.

**Parks:** Douglas Park is the neighbourhood gem, with a community centre, sports fields, and playground. Heather Park and Nat Bailey Stadium area are also close.

**Family perks:** Cambie Village shopping, direct Canada Line access at King Edward and Oakridge stations, growing restaurant scene, and proximity to major centres.

**Price range:** GVR benchmarks (Jan 2026) — Condos $1.02M; Townhomes $1.56M; Detached $4.16M

## 5. Marpole

**Best for:** Budget-conscious families who don't want to sacrifice location

Marpole offers some of the best value in Vancouver's westside. With improving amenities, excellent transit, and proximity to the Fraser River, it's increasingly popular with young families.

**Schools:** David Lloyd George Elementary and Sir Wilfrid Laurier Elementary are both solid. Sir Winston Churchill Secondary serves the area.

**Parks:** Marpole Park, Ash Park, and the Fraser River waterfront. Oak Park has excellent playground facilities.

**Family perks:** Most affordable westside neighbourhood, YVR access, growing dining scene on Granville Street, community centre, and strong multicultural character.

**Price range:** GVR benchmarks (Jan 2026) — Condos $684K; Townhomes $1.58M; Detached $2.13M

## How to Choose the Right Neighbourhood

When helping families find their neighbourhood, I always suggest considering:

1. **School catchments** — Check the VSB website for current catchment boundaries
2. **Commute times** — Map your daily routes during rush hour
3. **Park proximity** — Families with young kids benefit from a playground within walking distance
4. **Community amenities** — Pools, libraries, community centres, and rec programs
5. **Growth trajectory** — Is the neighbourhood improving? New developments, transit expansions, and infrastructure investment signal future value
6. **Budget reality** — Balance wants with what's financially comfortable long-term

## Let's Find Your Family's Neighbourhood

Every family is different, and the "best" neighbourhood depends entirely on your priorities, budget, and lifestyle. I'd love to help you explore the options and find the perfect fit.
